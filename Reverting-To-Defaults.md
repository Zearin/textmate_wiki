Many problems can be solved by reverting to default settings. To do so, quit TextMate, then remove the following files and folders:

 1. `~/Library/Application Support/Avian`
 1. `~/Library/Application Support/TextMate`
 1. `~/Library/Caches/com.macromates.TextMate/BundlesIndex.binary`
 1. `~/Library/Preferences/com.macromates.TextMate.preview.plist`
 1. `~/.tm_properties`

**Note:** Not all of these files/folders may exist, and any potential customizations will be lost.

**Note:** As `.tm_properties` files can be in arbitrary folders, you may have more than the one in your home folder. But if you never created any, there is no reason to go hunting for them; TextMate doesnâ€™t create these by itself.
