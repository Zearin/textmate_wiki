Many problems can be solved by reverting to default settings. This is done by quitting TextMate and then removing the following files and folders:

 1. `~/Library/Application Support/Avian`
 1. `~/Library/Application Support/TextMate`
 1. `~/Library/Caches/com.macromates.TextMate/BundlesIndex.plist`
 1. `~/Library/Preferences/com.macromates.textmate.plist`
 1. `~/.tm_properties`

Be aware that not all files/folders listed may exist, and any potential customizations will be lost.

As `.tm_properties` files can be in arbitrary folders, you may have more than the one in your home folder. Though TextMate doesnâ€™t create these by itself, so if you never created any, there is no reason to go hunting for them.
