# While awaiting major bundle editor re-write

1. Make Right-click items shows "Open" (as text file in tm) and "Open in Finder"
2. Make Cmd-click window titlebar icon shows regular finder hierarchy
3. Default new item has cursor in "name" field

3. Either 

a) Add GUI for item movement
 * Duplication of items
 * Drag and drop move
or
b). Make dealing with text easier
 * Expose cmd and snippet  UUIDs in the drawer (plenty of space) to facilitate copying of uuid for rearranging the bundle folders etc.
 * Expose plist in bundle editor, and sort it for human eyes on open (i.e., meaningfully not alphabetically)

1. Fill in a default scope with the bundle's main file-type
