A bug report should contain these 4 things:

1. **Steps to reproduce**: You should give **detailed** steps on how someone can reproduce the problem. Keep the steps to a minimum, don’t make them vague, and include everything necessary to reproduce these steps.

2. **Expected result**: It’s important to include the result you are expecting to see from following the steps. It might be that you are simply having a different idea of what the expected result should be.

3. **Actual result**: This is also important because it could be that following your steps does not stray away from the expected result, when performed on another system.

4. **Environment**: This would be OS version, version of TextMate, and other possibly relevant information, for example if you are seeing graphics artifacts and you are on a retina Macbook Pro, then you should include that.

If you include pictures or movies then be sure that the bug report is still useful even if that information was not included. For example opening an issue stating that “syntax highlight is incorrect” and only including an image is not useful.

Even if the bug affects your productivity negatively, refrain from telling us that you are annoyed, that it is frustrating, or similar. This just sends an unnecessary negative vibe.
