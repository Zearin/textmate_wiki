A bug report should contain these 4 things:

1. **Steps to reproduce**: You should give **detailed** steps on how someone can reproduce the problem.
	* Start from scratch (e.g. _“1. Create a new document, 2. Change language to Ruby, 3. …”_).
	* Explicitly mention every action involved and how it is invoked, e.g. say _“Select Cut from the Edit menu”_ or alternatively _“Press <kbd>⌘X</kbd>”_ rather than _“delete the text”_.
	* Keep the steps to a minimum.

2. **Expected result**: It’s important to include the result you are expecting as it might differ from how the program was designed to work.

3. **Actual result**: This is also important because it could be that following your steps on a different system does not reproduce your issue.

4. **Environment**: This would be OS version, version of TextMate, the language you are working in, and other possibly relevant information, for example if you are seeing graphics artifacts and you are on a retina Macbook Pro, then you should include that.

If you include pictures or movies then be sure that the bug report can stand on its own even without these. For example opening an issue stating that “syntax highlight is incorrect” and only including an image is not useful.

If the bug affects your productivity negatively, it’s appreciated if you refrain from telling us how annoyed you are.
