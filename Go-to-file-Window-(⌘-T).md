## Issues
1. Tabs
	1. Choose folder target:
		* Allow user to drop a folder on the left-tab or file list to set the root folder
		* Double-click tab to open a choose-Folder dialog
		* âŒ˜-click Titlebar to navigate Finder hierarchy
	2. Draw tabs as in the main UI
	3. Have a distinct target for each tab?
2. Filter
	1. Rollover notes i.., is the filter string a glob or a regex?
	2. Merge glob filter into selection string? `+.md` = only return files containing .md
3. General
	1. Make this a proper window, able to be left open, and updating live
	2. Settings (location, filter combo) hold across openings
