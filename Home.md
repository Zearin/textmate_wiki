The TextMate wiki (at GitHub) is meant as a knowledge base for users of and contributors to TextMate.

While TextMate is under development, things will generally be documented first in the [change log][] then this wiki, and finally the [manual][] (presently the manual has not been updated for 2.0).

[change log]: https://github.com/textmate/textmate/blob/master/Applications/TextMate/about/Changes.md
[manual]: http://manual.macromates.com/en/

## Documentation
*   [[Hidden Settings]]
	Things you can only set via the `defaults` command.
*   [[FAQ]]

## Contributing
*   [[Hacking on the Code]]
	Starting points to start contributing, these are self-contained and therefore are approachable without knowledge of the full codebase.
*   [Writing Bug Reports](/textmate/textmate/wiki/writing_bug_reports)
	How we prefer to see bug reports being written.
