The TextMate wiki (at GitHub) is meant as a knowledge base for users of and contributors to TextMate.

While TextMate is under development, things will generally be documented first in the [change log][], then this wiki, and finally the [manual][]. (Presently, the manual hasnâ€™t been updated for 2.0.)

[change log]: https://github.com/textmate/textmate/blob/master/Applications/TextMate/about/Changes.md
[manual]: http://manual.macromates.com/en/
